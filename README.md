# Nexus Project 1: Machine Learning Models from Scratch

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue.svg)

This project is an educational exploration into the fundamentals of machine learning. It features implementations of several core algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy, demonstrating the underlying mechanics of each model. The goal is to build, train, test, and save these models for basic predictive tasks.

##--> Features

* Custom implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch.
* Custom implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification.
* Custom implementation of **Logistic Regression** for classification.
* Scripts for training, evaluating, and saving each model.
* Clean, organized, and scalable project structure.

##--> Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate the model logic from the training/testing scripts.
